## What is WhereRoulette?  🎰🌍

WhereRoulette is a web application designed to randomly select a [point of interest](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Points_of_interest) (POI) within a specified area. This tool solves the problem of choosing a place to go when you need somewhere to meet with friends, but the specific location isn't that important.

## How does WhereRoulette work? 🛠️

1. Chose type of place you want to go to:
    * Bar
    * Restaurant
    * Cafe
1. Define the area you want to search in:
    * Search by district name
    * Search by central point and radius
    * Search by bounding box
    * Search by the equidistance between your and your friends' locations -->
1. Data is fetched from OpenStreetMap and displayed on the map.
1. Spin the wheel to randomly select a POI.
1. Share the result with your friends.

## How to share this magic? 🤙

You can share your result easily with your friends using the share button.

This copies a URL to your clipboard. The URL has the chosen POI encoded in it, so you can share it with your friends and they can see the same result.

## Why is a POI not showing up? 🤔

This could be due to the absence of the POI in OpenStreetMaps. WhereRoulette only shows POI's in the OSM database.

## What is OpenStreetMaps? 🗺️

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative initiative to create a free and editable map of the world. It's a community-driven project where individuals and organizations contribute to the data collection. This data is freely available for anyone to modify, download, and use. WhereRoulette, along with many other web projects, utilizes OSM's extensive  data and rich basemaps.

## How can I add a POI? 🙋

Follow the instructions on the [OpenStreetMap website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to add or edit a waterway.

Once the POI is included in OpenStreetMap, it will become accessible to all OSM users and should appear on WhereRoulette immediately.

By doing this, you're not only enhancing your own experience but also making a valuable contribution to the global mapping community!

## What about my data? 🛡️

All data is processed locally on your device (the one the are using right now) and nothing is sent to WhereRoulette servers.

## How can I contact you? 📨

## Why is it called WhereRoulette? 📚

The name WhereRoulette is a play on the words "where" and "roulette" and relates to the random selection of a place to meet."
